# Cyber Security Lab

This project is a web-based, interactive terminal simulator for learning basic cybersecurity concepts. It's a single HTML file that creates a "Capture The Flag" (CTF) style learning environment in your browser.

## Features

- **Zero Installation:** Runs entirely in your web browser. No need to install VMs or other software.
- **Interactive Terminal:** A simulated Linux terminal to practice commands.
- **CTF Challenges:** Multiple levels of challenges that mirror real-world security analyst tasks.
- **Safe Environment:** All commands are simulated, so it's completely safe to use.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `cyber_lab.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Follow the "Mission Briefing" on the left side of the screen.
3.  Use the terminal on the right to enter commands and find the answers to the challenges.
4.  When you find an answer, use the `submit [answer]` command to proceed to the next level.

## Deployment

This project can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages to make it accessible via a public URL.

1.  Create a new public repository on GitHub.
2.  Upload the `cyber_lab.html` file to the repository.
3.  In the repository's settings, go to the "Pages" section.
4.  Select the main branch as the source and click "Save".
5.  Your lab will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/cyber_lab.html`.
